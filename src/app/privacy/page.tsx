          note when someone mentions you in a comment. Mail is delivered by Resend, which handles your address for that

            <b>Analytics.</b> We count page views and a few product events (such as “a trade was placed”) with Umami,
            run on our own server. It sets no cookies and stores no IP address; addresses are used only in passing, to
            tell visits apart and to find a country. Page addresses are stripped of anything personal before they are
            sent, and events never carry an email, name, handle or amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Paper views.</b> A paper’s view count counts each visitor once a day. A visitor is your account when
            signed in, otherwise your network address; what is stored is a keyed hash of it and the day, deleted after
            two days. Which paper was read after which is kept only as a total per pair of papers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Activity log.</b> We log which pages and markets signed-in accounts look at, to run and improve the site.
            The log holds no content of what you did, only that it happened.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cloudflare</b> sits in front of the site, protects it from abuse and so sees every visitor’s network
            address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cookies and browser storage</b> are only functional: the sign-in session, whether you have seen the
            welcome page, which home-page sections you left open, and a random token that ties a bet chosen during
            sign-up to this browser. Your browser’s own storage remembers a pending confirmation and the last paper you
            read. None of it tracks you elsewhere.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The basis for all of this is our legitimate interest in running a secure, working site and knowing how it is
          used (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).
