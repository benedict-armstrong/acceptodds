/**
 * Product events for Umami (`window.umami.track`), for funnels: where people
 * leave sign-up, sign-in and the first trade, and what they do after.
 *
 * Event data is **not personal, by construction**: only the fields listed in
 * `EventData` below, each a short code or a flag. Never an email, handle,
 * name, id or amount — the page URL is filtered in `lib/analytics.ts` for the
 * same reason, and these must not be a way around it. Add a field here only if
 * it is as harmless as the ones already there.
 *
 * Does nothing server-side, before the tracker has loaded (it retries for a
 * few seconds, since the script is added after hydration), or when analytics
 * is off.
