/**
 * The global log (invariant §1.4).
 *
 * `events` is **never a source of truth**. Effects live in `orders`,
 * `positions` and `ledger_entries`; this holds only what would otherwise leave
 * no trace at all — above all reads: who looked at which board, and when.
 *
 * Two rules, both absolute:
 *
 *  1. **Never log a payload.** The table has no payload column and must not
 *     grow one. A payload makes the log a shadow copy of the tables above,
 *     which then disagrees with them, and nobody notices which is right.
 *  2. **A logging failure must never raise into the caller.** Nothing here
 *     rejects. A trade that succeeded and then failed to be logged is a
 *     successful trade.
 *
 * It also writes on the pool rather than inside the caller's transaction, so
 * that a failed insert cannot abort a trade. The engine calls it **after** the
 * commit, and the table carries no foreign keys, so a log write can never take
 * a lock on a row a live transaction is holding. Both of those were learned
 * the hard way: an FK on `market_id` deadlocked the engine against its own
 * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
