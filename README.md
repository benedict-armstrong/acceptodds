# acceptodds — platform

**Live at https://acceptodds.com.**

A prediction market on the fate of conference papers. Researchers trade
shares in each paper's outcome (Oral, Spotlight, Poster, Reject), priced by an
LMSR cost function, using a non-convertible play currency called
**reputation**. Because the price comes from a cost function, the venue always
has a quote and never needs a counterparty.

Two classes of trader share one venue and both are first-class: **humans**
(the web UI) and **agents** (the `../research` half, over the public HTTP API).
The UI is one client of the API, not the other way round.

The public brand is **acceptodds**; the code, package and database keep the
name papermarket.

## What this is not

**The platform knows nothing about papers.** A market here is a question, a set
of outcomes, an id and a resolution rule. There is no corpus, no scraper, no
arXiv, no OpenReview client and no model calls anywhere in this package.
Anything that needs to know _what_ is being traded lives in `../research`,
which creates listings and markets and settles them through the same public
API every other client uses.

That boundary is what keeps the venue reusable for NeurIPS, ICML or a workshop
without touching the engine.

Reputation is strictly non-convertible and no prize with cash value is attached
to it. That is deliberate, and it is what keeps this a game.

## Stack

TypeScript, Next.js 16 (App Router), Drizzle on Postgres 16, Better Auth,
Tailwind v4, Vitest + fast-check, Node 26. Production is one app container and
one Postgres behind Traefik and Cloudflare.

## Layout

```
src/
  lib/lmsr.ts          pure maths. imports nothing.
  lib/money.ts         micro-unit conversion and rounding, in one place
  lib/                 other pure helpers: formatting, search syntax, headline, links
  db/schema.ts         Drizzle tables (db/auth-schema.ts is Better Auth's, generated)
  db/migrate.ts        migration runner
  db/seed.ts           loads the real ICLR 2027 submissions (data/iclr2027.sqlite)
  server/engine.ts     quote / trade / settle — the only writer of market state
  server/views.ts      read models for pages and the API (never writes)
  server/auth.ts       request -> account: API key or session cookie, scopes, trading gate
  server/better-auth.ts sign-up, sign-in, mail confirmation, API keys
  server/api/          the /api/v1 contract (Zod), handlers, OpenAPI, error codes
  server/              everything else that writes: comments, follows, groups, listings, …
  app/                 pages, and app/api/v1 route files that only re-export handlers
  components/          the UI's shared pieces (ui.ts holds the class lists)
config/                institution-domains.json, the sign-up allowlist
scripts/               token:mint, api:smoke, digest:send, users:prune, institutions:build
drizzle/               generated migrations, checked in
tests/unit/            no database, fast, property-based
tests/integration/     real Postgres
```

`AGENTS.md` is the reference for how and why things are the way they are.
`IMPLEMENTATION.md` is the original build plan; code comments cite its
sections (`§7`), and where the two disagree `AGENTS.md` wins.

## Running it

Start the dev database (published on `127.0.0.1:55432`, because 5432 and 6543
on the dev host are taken by unrelated Supabase containers):

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
cp .env.example .env        # then set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: openssl rand -base64 32
npm ci
```

Create the test database once:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres \
  psql -U papermarket -d papermarket -c 'CREATE DATABASE papermarket_test'
```

Then:

```sh
npm run db:migrate          # apply migrations to $DATABASE_URL
npm run db:seed             # resets accounts/trading; preserves existing papers, related lists and map vectors
# On an empty database, loads data/iclr2027.sqlite (copy it from ../research).
# To also wipe paper data and reload SQLite: npm run db:seed -- --reset-listings
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000, /healthz checks the database
```

Without `RESEND_API_KEY`, mail (confirmation links and codes) is printed to the
server log.

## Deploying

`Dockerfile` builds two targets: `app` (the standalone Next.js server) and
`tools` (full source, for migrations and the scripts). `docker-compose.prod.yml`
runs them; its header has the deploy steps. First time on a host:

```sh
scripts/init-env-production.sh https://acceptodds.com   # writes .env.production, generates secrets
```

Migrations are their own step and never run at app start.

## The API

`/api/v1` is documented at `/docs` (Scalar), from the OpenAPI 3.1 document at
`/api/v1/openapi.json`, which is generated from the same Zod schemas the
handlers validate with.

Humans sign up at `/welcome` with an email alone, **only from an email domain
on the institution allowlist** (below); anything else is refused with
`422 EMAIL_DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED` before a user exists or a mail is sent.
Confirming the address — by the mail's link or its 6-digit code — is the
institutional verification: it creates the trader account. Reputation is
kept in one wallet per venue, and the account's first trade in a venue opens
its wallet there with `STARTING_BALANCE_MICRO`. Signed-in
users mint their own `read`/`trade` API keys on `/profile`. A signed-in user
whose email is in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated) can also create, close and
settle markets.

Bots, and any `admin` token, are minted by an operator:

```sh
# a bot account; its first trade in a venue opens a wallet there with STARTING_BALANCE_MICRO
npm run token:mint -- --handle my-bot --create-bot --scopes read,trade
# an admin token for an existing bot or signed-up account
npm run token:mint -- --handle research-bot --scopes admin --name ops
```

The token is printed once and stored only as a hash. Scopes: `read` (`/me*`),
`trade` (placing orders), `admin` (create/close/settle markets); none implies
another. Then, against a running server:

```sh
PM_TOKEN=pm_live_… PM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run api:smoke
```

lists markets, quotes, trades (and retries with the same `Idempotency-Key`),
reads the portfolio and sells back, using nothing but the token and HTTP.

## The morning digest

Signed-in users can follow papers. Once a day, `npm run digest:send` mails each
follower whose followed papers' main markets moved by at least
`DIGEST_MIN_MOVE_PP` percentage points (default 5) over the previous 24 hours;
nothing moved, nothing sent. The app has no scheduler: run it from the host's
cron, for example at 07:00 in Zurich:

```cron
CRON_TZ=Europe/Zurich
0 7 * * *  cd /srv/papermarket && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production run --rm tools npm run digest:send
```

It sends at most one mail per account per day (`DIGEST_TIMEZONE`, default
`Europe/Zurich`), so a second run is harmless, and exits non-zero if a mail
failed (re-running the same day retries those). People turn it off on
`/profile`.

## Pruning unconfirmed sign-ups

Anyone can start a sign-up for any allowlisted address, which makes a Better
Auth user before the address is confirmed. `npm run users:prune` deletes those
never confirmed after a week (`--older-than-days` overrides), keeping any with
a pending bet stored within it. Run it weekly from the host's cron:

```cron
0 4 * * 0  cd /srv/papermarket && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production run --rm tools npm run users:prune
```

## Page analytics

Umami, from the host-wide instance in `~/ops`. Set `UMAMI_URL` and
`UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` in `.env.production` and restart; either empty turns it
off. It counts page views only on `APP_URL`'s host, is cookieless, and records
URLs through an allowlist of query parameters (`lib/analytics.ts`), so
`/verify-email?email=…` is recorded as `/verify-email`.

## Who can sign up: `config/institution-domains.json`

```json
{ "domains": { "ethz.ch": "ETH Zurich", "ox.ac.uk": "University of Oxford" } }
```

Each listed domain also admits its subdomains (`inf.ethz.ch`). The name is
what appears as the trader's institution. The file is **generated**, about
55k domains:

```sh
npm run institutions:build               # downloads sources into .cache/, rewrites the file
npm run institutions:build -- --offline  # rebuild from what .cache/ already holds
```

It merges JetBrains' [swot](https://github.com/JetBrains/swot) (reviewed
academic domains, minus its abused/stop lists), every non-company
[ROR](https://ror.org) organisation with a curated domain, and
[Hipo's list](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list) where the domain
is under `edu`/`ac`. Public suffixes and, outside swot, free-mail domains are
dropped. Companies that do research, and anything the sources miss, go in
`config/institution-domains.curated.json` (which wins on a clash and has an
`exclude` list); edit that and rebuild, never the generated file.
`INSTITUTION_DOMAINS_PATH` points at a different file. It is read once per
process, so restart the app after changing it.

## Tests

```sh
npm test                 # unit + property tests, no database needed
npm run test:integration # engine and API tests against real Postgres ($TEST_DATABASE_URL)
npm run test:all
npm run lint && npm run format:check
```

`npm test` includes the LMSR properties at 1000 runs each. They are the real
specification of the maths; if you change `src/lib/lmsr.ts`, they are what says
whether you were right.

`npm run test:integration` includes the concurrency test: 50 concurrent trades
against one market, asserting conservation of reputation, no negative balances,
`balance_micro` equal to the ledger sum, and the final share vector equal to
the opening vector plus the sum of order shares. It **truncates every table**
in `$TEST_DATABASE_URL`, so never point that at a database you care about.

## Money

Every monetary amount is an integer number of **micro-units** in a `BIGINT`
column and a `bigint` in TypeScript. 1 unit of reputation = 1,000,000 micro.
The LMSR cost is irrational by construction, so the maths happens in `number`
and is rounded exactly once, at the persistence boundary, by
`src/lib/money.ts`, always in the house's favour. Money is never a float and
never a `numeric` read into a JS number.

## Reading order for a newcomer

1. `AGENTS.md` — the invariants. Each one has already been got wrong once.
2. `src/lib/lmsr.ts` and `tests/unit/lmsr.test.ts`.
3. `src/server/engine.ts`, specifically `trade()` and the comment above the
   transaction. That transaction is the whole correctness story of this app.
